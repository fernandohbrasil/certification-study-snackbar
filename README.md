# Certification Study SnackBar

This application is part of a series of Apps that I am developing following the Studies guide of [Associate Android Developer](https://developers.google.com/certification/associate-android-developer).

## Motivation 

The purpose of this application was to explore some possibilities that [SnackBar](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/snackbar/Snackbar) have.

## Content

The following methods were covered

* B addCallback (BaseCallback<B> callback)
* void dismiss()
* Snackbar setAnimationMode(int animationMode)
* Snackbar setActionTextColor (int color)
* Snackbar setAction (CharSequence text, View.OnClickListener listener)
* Snackbar setBackgroundTint (int color)
* Snackbar setTextColor (int color)
* void show()

## Final

This App is really simple, and was focused just in [SnackBar](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/snackbar/Snackbar), so no specific architecture was observed. Feel free to use this example to start your studys, change the code and add in your repository as well.
